                 <h1>About Tamatert</h1>
                <p>
                  Tamatert’s origins are largely undocumented and are passed down by word of mouth. 
                  Tamatert began with a group of three Amazigh families that settled in the village. 
                  Now the village comprises seven, close-knit families. 
                  The French came to the region to trek around and summit Mount Toubkal, which they measured and 
                  declared to be the highest peak in North Africa. Much of the documented information about 
                  this region comes from the physical data collected by the French, so it excludes relevant 
                  cultural or historical information.

                 <h1>The Meaning of Tamatert</h1>
                <p>
                  There are several meanings of Tamatert that vary by family. 
                  One of these meanings is “exposed land to the sun;” the 
                  snow remains on the surrounding mountain tops, but melts 
                  in the village as it is exposed to the sun for the entire 
                  day. Another meaning of Tamatert is “an example.” This 
                  meaning does not have a direct translation and might not 
                  have as significant a cultural meaning in English; however,
                   it can be interpreted in a number of ways. Being an 
                   example or role model to another is one interpretation. 
                   As of 2009, there was no road from Imlil to Tamatert, 
                   only a footpath. Five years prior in 2004 a Swiss woman, 
                   Jacqueline Brandt, established the village’s first known 
                   lodging for visitors: Douar Samra. Brandt built a 
                   traditional Amazigh house of pisé, wood, and stone with 
                   comfortable beds and toilets for visitors to Tamatert. 
                   The lodge became a part of the community, using bread 
                   baked by neighbors and involving locals in management. 
                   Since Douar Samra’s opening, several other inns have 
                   opened in Tamatert, welcoming visitors to the village.

                  Tamatert is one of many villages in the town of Imlil, Marrakech, Morocco.
                  It doesn't sit in the mountains where the snow sticks around, nor is it 
                  in the town center hub. Tamatert is it's own getaway with it's own story.
                  The Solstice is a gathering held in the village to celebrate it's own unique identity.
